# curriculum
This is my curriculum for teaching coding to high school students. I teach AP CS level.
The curriculum is completely different than that provided by the AP, but my students do well on the AP exams.
And they aren't bored to death and turned off coding.

The [text book](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Yva0fEXd06WrMscaq2EShdaPEC-2Uwdr6r7zEvrwv0/edit) covers the material needed for the exam. Additionally, the students learn numerics, vector geometry, abstraction, and other important ideas using a project that isn't contrived.
