# curriculum
This is my curriculum for teaching coding to high school students at the AP CS level.
The curriculum is completely different than that provided by the AP, but my students do well on the AP exams.
And they aren't bored to death and turned off coding.

Over the course of a year, the students write code to create 3D computer generated images such as the one above, using first principles. We make use of no computer graphics libraries and only basic math functions, such as sin() and cos().

The [text book](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Yva0fEXd06WrMscaq2EShdaPEC-2Uwdr6r7zEvrwv0/edit) covers the material needed for the exam. Additionally, the students learn numerics, vector geometry, abstraction, and other important ideas using a project that isn't contrived.
